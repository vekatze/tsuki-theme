** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; with straight.el
(use-package tsuki-theme
  :straight
  (:host github :repo "vekatze/tsuki-theme")
  :init
  (load-theme 'tsuki t))
#+end_src

** Pros
- Extensive use of background colors for faster structure recognition (YMMV)
- Tetradically chosen colors for better contrast
  - e.g. ~blue = #78c8f0~ derives ~magenta = #dc78f0, orange = #f0a078, green = #8cf078~
- Great Kawaii Experience

** Cons
- Works only in GUI
- External package support is limited
  - PRs are welcomed

** Notes
