** Pros
- Extensive use of background colors for faster structure recognition (YMMV)
- Tetradically chosen colors for better contrasts
  - e.g. ~blue = #78c8f0~ derives ~magenta = #dc78f0, orange = #f0a078, green=#8cf0f8~

** Cons
- Works only in GUI
- Package supports are currently limited for my use (PRs are welcomed)
