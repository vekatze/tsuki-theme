** Install
TBD

** Pros
- Extensive use of background colors for faster structure recognition (YMMV)
- Tetradically chosen colors for better contrast
  - e.g. ~blue = #78c8f0~ derives ~magenta = #dc78f0, orange = #f0a078, green=#8cf078~
- Great Kawaii Experience

** Cons
- Works only in GUI
- External package support is limited (PRs are welcomed)

** Notes
*** mini-frame
If you're using [[https://github.com/muffinmad/emacs-mini-frame][mini-frame]], you may want to do something like this:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Set border color to blue (You can also use Customize, of course)
(setq mini-frame-internal-border-color (tsuki-theme-get-color 'blue tsuki-theme-palette))
#+end_src
